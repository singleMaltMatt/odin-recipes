    <h2>Bread</h2>

    <p>Whether you have a slice of bread in the morning for breakfast, or bread for a sandwich at noon, I think we can all agree that bread is the best invention since the wheel.</p>
    <p>Since ages long past, every generation has made a loaf of bread, and bread has become a staple food for many.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 Cups</strong>Warm Water</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tablespoon</strong>White Sugar</li>
        <li><strong>10g / 1 Sachet</strong>Active Dry Yeast</li>
        <li><strong>1.5 Teaspoons</strong>Salt</li>
        <li><strong>Quarter Cup</strong>Oil</li>
        <li><strong>6 Cups</strong>White Bread Flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam.</li>
        <li>Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well oiled 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
