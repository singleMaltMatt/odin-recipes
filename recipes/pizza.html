    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the sugar in warm water, and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast
            resembles a creamy foam.</li>
        <li>Mix salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface
            until smooth. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise
            until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into loaves, and place into two well
            oiled 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.</li>
