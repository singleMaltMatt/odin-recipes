    <h2>Pizza</h2>

    <p>There is not a single soul on Earth that does not enjoy a slice of pizza.</p>
    <p>Originating in Italy, this circular dish topped with cheese, cheese and more cheese, oh and some other stuff like
        pepperoni, cheese, basil, olives, tomatoes, ricotta and cheese, can be found on any restaurant's menu around the
        world.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h3>For Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 and a Half Cups</strong>Warm Water</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tablespoon</strong>White Sugar</li>
        <li><strong>10g / 1 Sachet</strong>Active Dry Yeast</li>
        <li><strong>1.5 Teaspoons</strong>Salt</li>
        <li><strong>Quarter Cup</strong>Oil</li>
        <li><strong>3.5 Cups</strong>White Bread Flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Toppings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese, <strong>grated</strong></li>
        <li>Mushrooms, <strong>raw, very thinly sliced</strong></li>
        <li>Bell peppers, <strong>very thinly sliced</strong></li>
        <li>Black olives, <strong>sliced</strong></li>
        <li>Basil, <strong>fresh, chopped</strong></li>
        <li>Onions, <strong>thinly sliced, or caramalized</strong></li>
        <li>Ham, <strong>thinly sliced.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h3>For Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water
            and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved. After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't
            dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and
            alive.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a
            minute. Then
            replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.

            Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.

            If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.

            The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more
            flour.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn
            it around
            so that it gets coated with the oil.

            At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours
            in the
            fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place)
            will allow
            the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.

            Cover the dough with plastic wrap.

            For a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75째F to 85째F) for 1 1/2 hours.

            For a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine)
            for 8 hours.
            For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).

            The longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Continue...</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475째F for at least 30
            minutes,
            preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you
            need something
            that will not warp at high temperatures.</li>
        <li>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a
            bit. Divide
            the dough in half.

            Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or
            up to 2
            hours).</li>
        <li>Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of
            toppings as the
            crust will end up not crisp that way.

            About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms
            thinly
            sliced will cover a pizza.</li>
        <li>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly
            floured work
            surface.

            Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn
            and stretch
            the dough until it will not stretch further.

            Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter - 10 to
            12 inches.

            Treat the dough gently!

            You can also hold up the edges of the dough with your fingers, letting the dough hang and stretch, while
            working around
            the edges of the dough.

            If a hole appears in your dough, place the dough on a floured surface and push the dough back together to
            seal the hole.

            Use your palm to flatten the edge of the dough where it is thicker. Pinch the edges if you want to form a
            lip.</li>
        <li>Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush
            the top of
            the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another 10-15
            minutes.

            Repeat with the second ball of dough.</li>
        <li>Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal. (The corn meal will act as little
            ball bearings
            to help move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.)

            Transfer one prepared flattened dough to the pizza peel.

            If the dough has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly shape it to the desired dimensions.</li>
        <li>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful
            not to
            overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake
            the peel to
            see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more
            cornmeal.

            Slide the pizza off of the peel and onto the baking stone in the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake pizza in the 475째F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about
            10-15 minutes.
            If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
