            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <h3>For Sushi Rice</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2 Cups</strong>Shortgrain rice</li>
                <li><strong>3 Cups</strong>Water</li>
                <li><strong>Half a Cup</strong>Rice wine vinegar</li>
                <li><strong>1 Tablespoon</strong>Vegetable Oil</li>
                <li><strong>Quarter Cup</strong>White sugar</li>
                <li><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> Salt</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For Sushi Rolls</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Nori</em> (Dried seaweed sheets)</li>
                <li>Crabsticks</li>
                <li>Salmon</li>
                <li>Cucumber</li>
                <li>Carrots</li>
                <li><em>Daikon</em> radish</li>
                <li><em>Kewpie</em> Sushi Mayonnaise</li>
                <li>Sesame seeds, regular and black</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps for Rice</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander until the water runs clear.
                <li>Combine with water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Rice should be tender and water should be absorbed.</li>
                <li>Cool until cool enough to handle.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar and salt.</li>
                <li>Cook over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.</li>
                <li>Cool, then stir into the cooked rice. When you pour this in to the rice it will seem very wet. Keep stirring and the rice will dry as it cools.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Steps for Rolls</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare your Sushi Mat, as a tip, cover the mat with cling wrap for a less messy experience!</li>
                <li>Place a Nori sheet onto your mat.</li>
                <li>Place a fistful of Sushi rice on the sheet and flatten gently into a square shape covering all visible areas of the sheet.</li>
                <li>Place your desired fillings onto the rice; carrot, cucumber, radish and crabsticks is a great combination.</li>
                <li>Start at end of the mat closest to you, and <em>carefully</em> but <strong>tightly</strong> roll the mat away from you in order to form your sushi rolls</li>
                <li>Now that you have a roll, dip the edge of a sharp nice into water and slice your rolls into even sections - a standard Nori sheet will yield 8 pieces of sushi, but slice as many as you can manage.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat steps 1 - 6</strong> how many times you'd like.</li>
                <li>Arrange your sushi neatly on a plate, sprinkle sesame seeds and top with a tiny squeeze of Kewpie.</li>
                <li>Serve and Enjoy!</li>
                
            </ol>
